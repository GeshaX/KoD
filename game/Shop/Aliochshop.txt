#Declaring a new line of text(camps separated by tab): Action	Item Name	Text
#Possible Actions(case sensitive, be careful): welcome, buy, leave, work, hover
#Declaring a Welcome, Leave or Work text: you only need to fill the camps Action and Text. For this purpose, set Item Name as Null.
#Declaring a work text: Keep in mind that after whatever you say here, the game will add how much you received at the end of the text automatically.
#Declaring buy or hover texts: you need to fill all 3 camps. Fill the Item Name camp with the Item's name, NOT the Item Object Name.
#You can do as many texts as you want in here, every action can have multiple texts, from 0 to infinity.
#Each item for the buy or hover action can also have as many texts as you want.
#The script will supply generic texts if no suitable ones are found in the text file.
