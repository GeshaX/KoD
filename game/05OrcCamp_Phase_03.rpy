    "Sabia woke up reasonably early, and since it was the day of her party, she went to the relief tents after another final round around the camp, making sure everyone knew it was on tonight."
    "After making sure everyone knew when her party would be, Sabia had spent most of the day setting up for the event. Jadk had come through and provided all the food and drink she needed."
    "The absolute final touches had been done, and she had gotten Tardak to help set up the little podium in one of the tents where she - that is, her guest - would be performing."
    "The ambiance was just a bit different from what she recalled of Tyra's parties, but that would come with time. She hadn't established herself yet."
    "Orcs lounged about, drinking Jadk's ale by the barrel, and making the food disappear quickly. A couple of catgirls darted this way and that, carrying more food and drink where it needed to go."
    "None of the captains had come and most of what Sabia would call their lieutenants hadn't come either."
    "But it was still a fairly large gathering, and the presence of a couple of catgirls and Neve, and Sabia lightened the mood a lot more."
    "She also heard snippets of conversation about how much cleaner the tents were now, and how much nicer it would be to fuck in them without them being so dirty and smelly."
    "Every inch gained was a small step closer to her goals, Sabia reminded herself. Bigger things could come later."

    "Nonetheless, Sabia found herself ready to perform after some time - c-string and plug lodged firmly inside her as well - and took a deep breath as she watched Neve go on stage ahead of her."
